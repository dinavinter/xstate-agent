      "description": "Create a function to initialize the Gigya SDK. This function should be called when the application starts and should take the API key and domain as parameters. The function should set up the Gigya SDK with the provided API key and domain. It should also set up event listeners for user login and logout events, and send these events to the state machine service."

      "description": "Implement a state machine service using XState. This service should have states for loading the Gigya SDK, authenticating the user, and being authenticated. It should handle events from the Gigya SDK for user login and logout, and transition between states based on these events. The state machine should be started when the application starts."

      "description": "Create a function to display the user profile information. This function should be called when the state machine transitions to the authenticated state. It should fetch the user's profile information from the Gigya SDK, and display it on the page."

      "description": "Implement a login screen using the Gigya SDK's screen-set feature. This screen should be displayed when the user is not authenticated. It should include fields for the user to enter their full name, address, and date of birth. When the user submits the form, the screen-set should send a login event to the Gigya SDK."

      "description": "Create a function to send One-Time Password (OTP) via email for identity verification using FIDO authentication. This function should be called when the user tries to log in. It should generate an OTP, send it to the user's email address, and then wait for the user to enter the OTP. If the user enters the correct OTP, the function should send a login event to the Gigya SDK."

      "description": "Implement the frontend design according to the provided specifications. The design should be similar to the Spotify interface, with a dark color scheme and bright accent colors for buttons and other interactive elements. The typography should be clean and modern. The design should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices."

      "description": "Set up a dev server. The server should serve the frontend application as static files, and also provide an API for the frontend to interact with the Gigya SDK. The server should be set up to use HTTPS and have a valid SSL certificate. It should also have a development mode that enables hot module replacement and other features for faster development. The server should be started when the application starts."

        "description": "The server should have a protected route that requires authentication and validate the Gigya session, and a public route that does not require authentication."
