# Role: Screen-Set Developer
Your expertise in frontend development is crucial for translating user requirements into functional screen set, you can also get an existing screen and apply changes it.

## Gather Requirements:

- Engage with the user proxy to get more information if required. Use your skills to ask precise questions, guiding the design and functionality of the screen-sets. Provide examples to clarify options and assist in decision-making.

## Develop and Test:

- Create the screen-sets using HTML, ensuring they are responsive and accessible.
- Use iterceptor to call https://accounts.gigya.com/accounts.getSchema?apiKey=<apikey from user> to fetch available fields
- Use https://accounts.gigya.com/accounts.getScreenSets?apiKey=<apikey from user> if you need to use existing screens as an example or to navigate to existing screens
- Use Python Interceptor  for visualizing the screens.
- Use Python Interceptor to conduct thorough testing to guarantee functionality and user satisfaction.


# Screen-Set Definition Quick Guide:
**Basics:**
A collection of user interaction screens within a <div> tagged as \"gigya-screen-set\", each screen encapsulated in a <div> with class \"gigya-screen\".
**Attributes:**
Include unique identifiers, dimensions (data-width, data-height), optional captions, and responsive design settings.
**Forms and Fields:**
Utilize <form> tags and names for functionality of updating profile fields
**special fields
loginID, password, email, captchaText, etc: use data-bound-to attribute
**Error Handling:** Implement gigya-error-display and gigya-error-msg for clear user feedback.
**Responsive Design:** Use gigya-conditional for dynamic content display based on user conditions or screen size.
**Widgets and Events:** Incorporate widgets like gigya-social-login for enhanced features and handle events for custom actions.
**Navigation:** Control screen transitions  with data-switch-screen and conditional workflows with data-condition.
**Conditional Logic:** Use data-condition to dynamically show or hide content based on user responses or profile information.

## general attributes
data-width
data-height
class (not a data attribute, but relevant for styling and identification)

[//]: # (gigya-conditional:class &#40;conditional class based on a condition, e.g., screen width&#41;)

## Screen Set Container Attributes
data-responsive: Enables responsive design for the screen-set.
id: A unique identifier for the screen-set, which can include letters, numerals, underscores, and hyphens.
data-width and data-height: Define the dimensions of the screen-set when presented in a dialog.

[//]: # (data-dialog-style  modern)

## Screen Level Attributes
data-width
data-caption: Caption of the screen.

## Forms
Defined within a <form> tag, with different classes available such as "gigya-login-form", "gigya-profile-form", etc., each encapsulating specific behaviors and expected input fields like loginID, password, etc. use get fields skill to fetch the available fields

### Special Fields
Reserved names like loginID, password, and email are used for specific functionalities within forms. use data-bound-to to bound a special field . for example <data-bound-to="loginID"..>

##  Component Level Attributes
data-login-identities (specifies the type of login identities to display, e.g., site-only, social, site-and-social, social-only)
gigya-conditional:value (conditional value based on a condition, e.g., screenset width)
data-bound-to (specifies the form field a component is bound to, for error messaging)
data-error-flags (specifies the condition under which an error message should be displayed)
data-condition (specifies a condition under which a component is displayed)
data-switch-screen (specifies the screen to switch to upon interaction)
data-units (specifies the size of a spacer component in units)


## Error Handling
Utilizes classes like gigya-error-display and gigya-error-msg for showing error states and messages. Validation and error state management are built into the system for efficient user feedback.
example: `<img class="gigya-error-display" data-bound-to="email" src="images/error.jpg">&nbsp;<span class="gigya-error-msg" data-bound-to="email"></span>`
### gigya-error-display
May be applied to any HTML element. Indicates that this element is bound to an error state of the bound object. The element will be automatically displayed when the bound object is in error state and hidden when the bound object is not in error state.
The attributes associated with this class:
- data-bound-to (required) - Indicates the object to which this error object is bound. A bound object may be:
- Any field name within the same form as this error object. In such a case, the error object will be displayed on focus-out of the bound field if it is in an error state.
- A form ID. In such a case, the object will be displayed when the form is submitted and its operation fails.
- data-scope (optional) - Attribute indicating the scope of this object. This attribute is relevant only when this error object is bound to a form. This attribute may receive one of the following values:
    - bound-object-error (default) - only errors of the bound object itself will cause this object to be displayed.
    - any-error - the error object will be displayed if there is an error in any of the fields within the bound form.
- data-error-codes (optional) - A list of error codes. When specified, the container will only be displayed if one of the specified error codes were returned by the bound element.

### gigya-error-msg
A container for automatically generated error messages. May be applied to a <div> or a <span> element. The element will be automatically displayed when the bound object is in error state and hidden when the bound object is not in error state. This object behaves similar to the gigya-error-display object, except it also displays a predefined error message or an error message that comes from the server.
The attributes associated with this class:
- data-scope (optional) -Attribute indicating the scope of this object. This attribute is relevant only when this error object is bound to a form. This attribute may receive one of the following values:
  bound-object-error (default) - only errors of the bound object itself will cause this object to be displayed.
  all-errors - The object will display a list of all the error messages for all the fields within the bound form (checked locally before actually submitting the form) and the error received from the server. This option gives you the possibility to display all the errors of the form in one location.
  first-error - same as all-errors but instead of displaying all the errors it only displays the first one.
  data-error-codes (optional) - A list of error codes. When specified, the container will only be displayed if one of the specified error codes were returned by the bounded element.

data-on-pending-registration-screen

### Conditional workflows
enable dynamic screen transitions within the applications  Here's a detailed explanation of how to implement and utilize conditional workflows through the gigya-container class, the gigya-container purpose is to serves as a dynamic container for form elements, displaying or hiding its content based on specified conditions.
Usage: Must be applied only to <div> elements within a form to conditionally display content.

#### Key Attributes for Conditional Logic
- data-condition: The core of conditional workflows, this attribute accepts a JavaScript Boolean expression to determine the visibility of the container. It can evaluate user responses, profile information, or any other data on the page. Changes in related fields can dynamically show or hide the container without page refreshes.
  Example: data-condition="profile.gender=='m' && data.newsletter==true && window.myGlobalVar == 'john'"
- data-apikeys: A comma-separated list of API keys. The condition will be true only when the screen is loaded using one of these API keys.
- data-after-date and data-before-date: Use ISO 8601 date/time format to make content visible only before or after a certain date and time.
- data-domains - A comma-separated list of domain names or *.domain.name (for all subdomains of the parent domain). The condition becomes true only when the screen is loaded on a matching domain.
- data-empty-fields: Specifies fields within the container that must be filled for the container to be hidden. Using "*" means all fields within the container are checked. This is particularly useful for forms where conditional fields are required based on previous inputs.
- data-login-identities: Controls visibility based on the user's login status or identity type (e.g., social media vs. site registration). This allows for customized experiences for different user segments.
- data-prob: Introduces a probability factor, where the condition becomes true based on the defined probability value (0-1). This can be used for A/B testing or randomizing content display.




## Event Handling:
Supports global events (e.g., onLogin) and screen-set specific events (e.g., onBeforeSubmit, onAfterSubmit) for custom logic and integration with other systems.

create a custom registration screen set with email password and subscribtion, that in case of email existing error it show otp screen , after user succefuly perform the otp, it shows him a screen with a message that he already registered before and we are about to update his account with the subscribtion he just provided

gigya_screen_set_expert
To execute your request, we will break down the task into several smaller steps:

Create a custom registration screen set template with HTML structure including email, password, and subscription fields.
Handle the case for showing an OTP (One-Time Password) screen if an email already exists.
Show a final screen with a message informing the user that they have already registered and their account will be updated with the new subscription provided.
Let's start with the first part and then proceed step by step:

1. Create Custom Registration Screen Set Template
   Below is the basic HTML structure for the custom registration screen set. This code includes fields for email, password, and a subscription checkbox.

<div class="gigya-screen-set" id="custom-registration-screen-set">
    <!-- Registration Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="registration-screen">
        <form class="gigya-login-form">
            <label for="email">Email</label>
            <input type="email" name="email" data-bound-to="email" required>
            <img class="gigya-error-display" data-bound-to="email" src="images/error.jpg">
            <span class="gigya-error-msg" data-bound-to="email"></span>

            <label for="password">Password</label>
            <input type="password" name="password" data-bound-to="password" required>
            <div class="gigya-password-strength" data-bound-to="password"></div>
            
            <div class="gigya-subscription" name="subscriptions.news" data-label="Subscribe to our newsletter"></div>
            
            <button type="submit" data-switch-screen="otp-screen">Register</button>
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- OTP Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="otp-screen" data-dialog-style="modern">
        <p>Please enter the OTP sent to your email.</p>
        <form class="gigya-login-form">
            <label for="otp">OTP</label>
            <input type="text" name="otp" data-bound-to="otp" required>
            <button type="submit" data-switch-screen="update-notice-screen">Submit OTP</button>
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Update Notice Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="update-notice-screen" data-dialog-style="modern">
        <p>You are already registered. We are updating your account with the subscription you provided.</p>
    </div>
</div>
Step-By-Step Explanation:
Registration Screen: This screen contains a form for the user to enter an email, password, and an option to subscribe to a newsletter. The code also includes error handling for the email and password fields. Upon submitting, it tries to switch to the "otp-screen" assuming an API or JavaScript validates the email existence and decides to show the OTP screen. Note that in practice, the actual logic determining which screen to switch to should be based on a backend check.

OTP Screen: This screen is intended to be shown if a user tries to register with an email that already exists in the system. It prompts the user to enter the OTP sent to their email. If the provided OTP is correct (logic for verifying the OTP needs to be implemented in the backend), it switches to the "update-notice-screen".

Update Notice Screen: This final screen informs the user that they have already registered and that their account will be updated with the new subscription provided.

Note:
This implementation assumes there will be backend logic to:

Detect if the email already exists and trigger showing the OTP screen.
Verify the OTP entered by the user.
Update the user's subscription based on their input.
This code provides a front-end structure for the described flow. The actual API calls and screen transitions based on API responses should be implemented using JavaScript in conjunction with your backend system.

User
i only want the otp screen to be displayed if the user already exists

gigya_screen_set_expert
To achieve the desired user flow where the OTP screen is displayed only if the user already exists upon attempting registration, we must adjust the approach to include conditionals based on backend validation. Since the initial frontend setup cannot inherently check for the user's existence without backend support, this process generally involves JavaScript for AJAX requests or utilizing the backend directly. However, for illustrative purposes, I can show an HTML structure adjusted for this logic and describe how you might implement it with backend support.

Adjusted Custom Registration Screen Set Template
<div class="gigya-screen-set" id="custom-registration-screen-set">
    <!-- Registration Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="registration-screen">
        <form class="gigya-login-form" onsubmit="return handleRegistration(event)">
            <label for="email">Email</label>
            <input type="email" name="email" data-bound-to="email" required>
            <img class="gigya-error-display" data-bound-to="email" src="images/error.jpg">
            <span class="gigya-error-msg" data-bound-to="email"></span>

            <label for="password">Password</label>
            <input type="password" name="password" data-bound-to="password" required>
            <div class="gigya-password-strength" data-bound-to="password"></div>
            
            <div class="gigya-subscription" name="subscriptions.news" data-label="Subscribe to our newsletter"></div>
            
            <button type="submit">Register</button>
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- OTP Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="otp-screen" data-dialog-style="modern" style="display: none;">
        <p>Please enter the OTP sent to your email.</p>
        <form class="gigya-login-form" onsubmit="return handleOTP(event)">
            <label for="otp">OTP</label>
            <input type="text" name="otp" data-bound-to="otp" required>
            <button type="submit">Submit OTP</button>
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Update Notice Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="update-notice-screen" data-dialog-style="modern" style="display: none;">
        <p>You are already registered. We are updating your account with the subscription you provided.</p>
    </div>
</div>
Required JavaScript Logic:
handleRegistration(event): This function will prevent the form's default submission (event.preventDefault()) and instead send an AJAX request to the server with the email and password. If the server response indicates that the user already exists, it would dynamically show the OTP screen. This involves toggling the style.display property of the relevant elements.
handleOTP(event): Similar to handleRegistration, but this function sends the OTP for verification. Upon successful verification, it should then display the "Update Notice Screen".
Simple JavaScript Example:
function handleRegistration(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const email = document.querySelector('input[name="email"]').value;
    // Implement AJAX request to check email existence

    // Simulating an AJAX call with a timeout and a condition
    setTimeout(() => {
        const userExists = true; // This should come from your AJAX response
        if (userExists) {
            document.querySelector('[data-screen-id="registration-screen"]').style.display = 'none';
            document.querySelector('[data-screen-id="otp-screen"]').style.display = 'block';
        }
    }, 1000);
}

function handleOTP(event) {
event.preventDefault();
// Implement AJAX request to verify OTP

    // Simulating an OTP verification success
    setTimeout(() => {
        document.querySelector('[data-screen-id="otp-screen"]').style.display = 'none';
        document.querySelector('[data-screen-id="update-notice-screen"]').style.display = 'block';
    }, 1000);
}
This setup requires your backend to:

Determine if the user exists at registration attempt.
Handle OTP verification and show appropriate messages or actions based on the outcome.
This example demonstrates the frontend adjustments needed to control which screen is displayed based on user actions and backend responses. The precise implementation details and logic depend on your backend API and system design.

User
use data conditional attribute or data-on-**

gigya_screen_set_expert
Given the requirement to only display the OTP screen conditionally based on the existing user check, we can leverage the Gigya's data-condition attribute or the data-on-* event attributes for more dynamic screen navigation. However, since direct backend logic integration and dynamic conditional checks based on asynchronous operations (like AJAX calls) are beyond the plain HTML's capability, the outlined method here is more conceptual, demonstrating how you might structure your screens and use conditional logic in a Gigya context.

You would typically need JavaScript to dynamically set conditions or react to events in real-time. The use of data-condition and data-on-* attributes would be more straightforward in scenarios with synchronous validation or predefined conditions.

Let's adjust our HTML structure to reflect a more Gigya-specific, albeit still conceptual, approach using data-on-existing-login-identifier-screen to navigate to the OTP screen if the user exists.

Conceptual HTML Structure:
```html
<div class="gigya-screen-set" id="custom-registration-screen-set" 
     data-on-existing-login-identifier-screen="custom-registration-screen-set/otp-screen">
    <!-- Registration Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="registration-screen">
        <form class="gigya-login-form">
            <label for="email">Email</label>
            <input type="email" name="email" data-bound-to="email" required>
            <span class="gigya-error-msg" data-bound-to="email"></span>

            <label for="password">Password</label>
            <input type="password" name="password" data-bound-to="password" required>
            <div class="gigya-password-strength" data-bound-to="password"></div>
            
            <div class="gigya-subscription" name="subscriptions.news" data-label="Subscribe to our newsletter"></div>
            
            <button type="submit">Register</button>
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- OTP Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="otp-screen">
        <p>Please enter the OTP sent to your email.</p>
        <form class="gigya-login-form">
            <label for="otp">OTP</label>
            <input type="text" name="otp" data-bound-to="otp" required>
            <button type="submit" data-on-after-submit="custom-registration-screen-set/update-notice-screen">Submit OTP</button>
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Update Notice Screen -->
    <div class="gigya-screen" data-screen-id="update-notice-screen">
        <p>You are already registered. We are updating your account with the subscription you provided.</p>
    </div>
